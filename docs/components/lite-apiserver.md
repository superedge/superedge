# lite-apiserver

`lite-apiserver` is a light-weight version of the kube-apiserver running on the edge nodes. It acts as a proxy for requests from all components and pods on the edge node to the cloud apiserver, and caches the responses to achieve edge autonomy in case of the disconnected cloud -edge network.

`lite-apiserver` has the following functionalities:
- Caches request for all edge components (kubelet, kube-proxy, etc.) and pods running on edge nodes
- Provides various authentication mechanism for edge components and pods including X509 Client Certs, Bearer Token, etc.
- Caches requests from all kind of Kubernetes resources, including build-in Kubernetes resource and custom CRDs

## Installation
`lite-apiserver` can be run at the edge as Kubernetes pod or systemd service. See [**Installation Guide**]() to get more detail
