## Motivation

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals and non-goals of
this KEP.

There is currently no standard way to deploy Nginx Ingress in SuperEdge. This KEP
proposes a method to deploy Nginx Ingress in SuperEdge. It
aims for minimal additional configuration, making SuperEdge Nginx Ingress as easy
to use as Kubernetes.

### Goals

List the specific goals of the KEP.  What is it trying to achieve?  How will we
know that this has succeeded?

- Goal-A.
- Goal-B.

### Non-Goals

What is out of scope for this KEP?  Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.
-->
- Non-Goal-A.
- Non-Goal-B.

## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable.  This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets.  If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.
